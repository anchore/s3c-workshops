# Remediation

Recommendations and automation to help resolve issues more quickly. Give the developer what they need to move fast.

Anchore Enterprise provides capabilities to automatically alert developers of issues through their existing tools, such as Jira or Slack. 
It also lets users define actionable remediation workflows with automated remediation recommendations that can assist a course of action. 
This flexibility can support many use-cases and here are our top 10:

1. Provide remediation steps for software violating secure coding standards
2. Automate the flow of CVE fix information to developers
3. Provide ownership who owns the fix (upstream or us)
4. Integrate remediation to your notification & build service
5. Prioritize remediation that are actively being exploited
6. Provide recommended remediation steps in developer workflows
7. Enforce remediation standards via policy
8. Centralize recommended remediation into a plan of action
9. Automated remediation responses to stakeholders
10. Create timeouts for remediation using policy
