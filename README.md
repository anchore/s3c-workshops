# Software Security in the Real World

This tutorial steps you through deploying Anchore Enterprise in a POC test environment. We then walk you through a series of labs showcasing how you can secure your software supply chain.

> The deployment from this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready, and will receive limited support from Anchore, but don't let that stop you from learning!

## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is anyone who wants to understand how to secure their SDLC with basic container operational experience.
We support a number of deployment options from AWS to vanilla K8s and will provide you with some repeatable examples across a series of labs.

## Labs

After initial setup in prerequisites, each lab guides you through tried and tested examples across use cases from software visibility to reporting and remediation.
